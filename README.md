# Gazebo Simulation HW

This contains a simulation setup and sample control program for assignments in a
university robotics course.

This requires [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) and is intended to work on a
(non-virtualized) Ubuntu 20.04 or Debian 10 system.

This is a fork of Professor Tuck's repository, and the majority of the code was written by him.
This code is intended to solve assignment 1 in the course CS4610 at Northeastern University.

The code I have modified lies primarily in brain.cc in the nikhil-hw01 directory.
